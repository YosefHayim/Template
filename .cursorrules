DRY. No repetition.

Production-ready code only. No TODOs, placeholders, leftovers, or “later”.

Extract shared utils, hooks, flows, and templates when there is clear reuse.

Do not create README or documentation files unless explicitly requested.

If changes to instructions or architecture are needed, propose them before writing code.

Do not disable pylint. Fix all pylint issues.

TypeScript: never use `any`. Always use the most specific correct type.

Do not use `require`. Use static imports. Use `require` only to resolve unavoidable circular dependencies.

Do not import solely to re-export. Avoid re-exports.

Index files may only re-export modules. Never write logic in index files.

Do not rename variables during destructuring unless there is a real naming collision in the same scope.

Do not run or attempt to execute applications. Only produce code and indicate when it is ready to test.

Apps must use `"*"` for all dependencies. Dependency versions are defined only in the root `package.json`.

Load all required DB data in a single aggregation during initialization when applicable.

Before creating a new component or utility, verify if an existing solution is available in @manyapp/ui.
